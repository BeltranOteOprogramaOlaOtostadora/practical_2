Hi, my name is Beltran and this practical work is a way to show my teacher Moises my knowledge of HTML, CSS and Git.

Description:
This file, practical_2, is divided into 3 files. The first one is this readme file, which is used to show all the info of this web. The second one is a changes file, which shows the history of the repo. The last one, and the most important one, is the docs folder. This one contains the CSS folder, which holds the design of the full web in CSS language; the images folder, which has all the pictures used; the public folder, which contains the full body of the web (about me file, contact file, degree file, fce file, net file and topic file); and the index file, which is the main web page of the whole project.

Challenges:
In this project, our main challenge was to acquire enough knowledge of HTML and CSS. Even though this tool is basic-level, it looks easy and intuitive but poses a lot of problems when we try to go beyond the basics. Personally, the most difficult part for me was organizing the CSS, because I made a lot of different models and structures but fell short in terms of organizing them and being able to adapt the CSS files to the changes made. This led me to have a strange but functional CSS.
Another problem related to the organization of files came when trying to find the routes to the different files and their names. This posed some big problems while creating links inside the web.
The other big challenge came with using Git. At the start, my repository had a lot of problems because of my lack of knowledge of the commands and how to use Git. That's why I had to restart my repo and do everything from the beginning. The good thing was that my previous errors helped me go faster and do better the second time.

Conclusions:
Because the project has three main parts—HTML, CSS and Git—my conclusion will also be divided into three.
My conclusion about the HTML part is that the actual HTML language is not that hard and is really intuitive if you have a sheet with the different tags while programming.
My conclusion about the CSS file is that even though order can help a lot to make things easier, having a functional file is much easier than it may seem, because even if you repeat code, duplicate and change it, most of the time things will work perfectly fine.
My last conclusion about Git is that this tool is much more useful than it seems at the start and also, definitely, it has been the hardest part of all the work.
